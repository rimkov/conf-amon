#domains in banned list
#Don't bother with the www. or the http://

#The bannedurllist is for blocking PART of a site
#The bannedsitelist is for blocking ALL of a site

#As of DansGuardian 2.7.3 you can now include
#.tld so for example you can match .gov for example

#The 'grey' lists override the 'banned' lists.
#The 'exception' lists override the 'banned' lists also.
#The difference is that the 'exception' lists completely switch
#off *all* other filtering for the match.  'grey' lists only
#stop the URL filtering and allow the normal filtering to work.

#An example of grey list use is when in Blanket Block (whitelist)
#mode and you want to allow some sites but still filter as normal
#on their content

#Another example of grey list use is when you ban a site but want
#to allow part of it.

#To include additional files in this list use this example:
#.Include</etc/dansguardian/anotherbannedurllist>

#You can have multiple .Includes.

#List other sites to block:




#Blanket Block.  To block all sites except those in the
#exceptionsitelist and greysitelist files remove
#the # from the next line to leave only a '**':
# Fonctionnement LISTE BLANCHE
**

#Blanket IP Block.  To block all sites specified only as an IP
#remove the # from the next line to leave only a '*ip':
#*ip



#Remove the # from the following and edit as needed to use a stock
#squidGuard/urlblacklist blacklists collection.
# You will need to edit to add and remove categories you want
