#URL Regular Expression exceptions (with option to append to URL)
#
# The format is: "extended regular expression"+="straight string to append to url"
# E.g. "\.google\.co\.uk/search\?"+="&safe=active" would append "&safe=active" 
# to all urls that contain google.co.uk/search?  
#
# A blank append string will make a matched url an exception. 
#E.g.  To allow all mail sites
#   "//mail\..*"+=""

# Far more complicated matches are possible.  See other sources for examples
# of extended regular expressions.

# Force all google searches to very safe mode
"\.google\..*q="+="&safe=vss"

# Force all google searches to safe mode
#"\.google\..*q="+="&safe=active"
